        <li>1 cup of warm water.</li>
        <li>2 cups of bread flour and more for dusting.</li>
        <li>2 table spoons of olive oil.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of whitesugar.</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine.<br> Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
